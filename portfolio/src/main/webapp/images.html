          <h3>“On Canvas”</h3>

        <br>I become a part of everything I create, and
        <br>Everything I create becomes a part of me.<br>

        <br>When I cannot identify myself through words
        <br>I always have to put my ideas down on canvas.
        <br>Anyone can speak words that will be forgotten but
        <br>I cannot forget how I feel when seeing my paintings.<br>

        <br>When I do use words, their core pours out over my pieces
        <br>where the deepest of meanings can tell a story from only one word.<br>

        <br>A title,
        <br>as important as the shade of color I create,
        <br>type of brush I use,
        <br>and rhythm I feel when I paint,
        <br>an identifier as important as choosing to follow my passion
      </p>
      <p>I wrote this poem to express my love for painting as art form.
           More importantly, I explain why I give a title to every painting I create.</p>
